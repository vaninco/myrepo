# myrepo

Hello all,

This is the repository of Vanessa, MS Biostatistics student.

I downloaded Git Kraken on 8-29-17.

I created my first repository on github.com and then cloned it onto my C drive using the "clone with url" option in git kraken.

I opened the README.md file using notepad, and that seems to be working.

Later I staged the changes to my .md file and committed them in git kraken.

Soon I will push these changes to github.com.
